A few features have been added :
1)a clock button that will reset the time when u added a task since the task
starting time is recorded the moment a task is added to the list.
2)A timer feature which can either work as a timer for a time limit or a 
stopwatch . This feature is still under development:
		i)the countdown is more like countup i.e:counts up to a time
		ii)there is no pause or stop button 
3)Completed and Inconmplete tasks can be viewed in a list 
4)The time taken from the time task is added and task is completed is shown
in days:hours:months:seconds format
The starting time can be changed as mentioned in the first point.
